    <p>Hey Everyone! This is a giant resouce post made up of my bookmarks collected over the years. I've got alot saved up, but I'm sure there's way more to be added. I've tried to have as much variety as I can, Tutorials, progam help, colour creators, fonts and apps, so hopefully there something you can use. This might be pretty lenghtly, so use cmmd+f fo find the section that you need!</p>
